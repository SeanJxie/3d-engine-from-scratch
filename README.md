# 3d-engine-from-scratch
- With SDL (for window and line/pixel drawing) in C++

- Most of what I've learnt (everything except elementary matrix math, a few rendering algorithms, and mouse input) is from javidx9's amazing [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&list=RDCMUC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA&index=3)


- _**Note**_ that this is a learning project. The engine is by no means super optimized for industry level performance.

# Demo
The current implemented camera controls for the demo are:
- `W`: move forward
- `S`: move backward
- `A`: move left
- `D`: move right
- `LSHIFT`: move down
- `SPACE`: move up
- `MOUSE`: look around

Clipping has not yet been implemented so moving objects behind the camera breaks things.
