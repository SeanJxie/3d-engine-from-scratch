# 3d-engine-from-scratch
- With SDL (for window and line/pixel drawing) in C++

- Most of what I've learnt (everything except elementary matrix math and a few rendering algorithms) is from javidx9's amazing [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&list=RDCMUC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA&index=3)


- _**Note**_ that this is a learning project. The engine is by no means super optimized for industry level performance.
